Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

 

Example 1:


Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
Example 2:


Input: heights = [2,4]
Output: 4

class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: list[int]) -> int:
        stack = []  # stores indices
        max_area = 0
        heights.append(0)  # Sentinel to empty the stack at the end

        for i, h in enumerate(heights):
            while stack and heights[stack[-1]] > h:
                height = heights[stack.pop()]
                width = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
                max_area = max(max_area, height * width)
            stack.append(i)

        return max_area
